#MOBLOG

Small and easy software written in batch language that is helping getting logs from mobile (both iOS and Android) only for Windows.

Moblog is using ADB, iOSLogInfo and iMobileDevice library. Written by me to increase my productivity and my team in current work.

Moblog require installed iTunes or AppleApplicationSupport, AppleApplicationSupport64, AppleMobileDeviceSupport64 to connect properly with iOS device and to use iOS logs.

First menu is for quick and easy copy and install apps from your lan / local directory to connected Android device. 

Just unzip MOBLOG.rar file on your desktop.

All you have to do is to change directions and names in moblog.bat code.
